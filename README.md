# wunglr
The hidden side of tumblr.

Click the <kbd>â†¶W</kbd> button to flip a post and see the hidden text written on the other side. Inspired by [this tumblr post by morphimus](https://www.tumblr.com/morphimus/710837261845037056/it-looked-kinda-like-this-the-post-would-be-the).

### Installation - New Xkit version
Assuming you have [New Xkit](https://github.com/new-xkit/XKit) installed:

   1. On tumblr, open your browser's Devtools (with the <kbd>F12</kbd> key or <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+J</kbd>)

   3. Open the New Xkit menu and go to "Other" > "Advanced Settings" > "Xkit Editor"

   5. To prevent tumblr from redirecting you, quickly:

      2. Alt-tab to the Devtools Console
      3. Press Enter to input the line of code you typed earlier
      4. Wait for a popup saying something like "Leave site? Changes may not be saved", and Cancel it
2. In the Xkit editor, Click "New Extension" at the top left (Ctrl + E), and name it 'wunglr'
3. Go to the JSON (Ctrl + 4) tab, and delete the existing JSON
